# Personal-Voice-Assistant-Security
As a researcher in the field of audio signal processing, I have worked on securing the acoustic channel of personal voice assistants, such as Alexa and Google Home, by developing an attack and mitigation framework.

Key Accomplishments:

Developed an attack framework to craft jamming signals that target sensitive areas of wake word recognition in personal voice assistants, resulting in successful disruption of wake word detection.
Designed and tested various noise types, including white noise, ping noise, and babel noise, to create jamming signals by considering parameters such as SNR, bandwidth, and duration of the noise.
Developed a framework to detect the presence of noise in the wake word by analyzing audio signal properties such as pitch, short time energy, and phase, and calculating kurtosis of the noise signal.
Mitigated the attack by adversarial training a wake word detection model with audio samples that included noise in the sensitive areas.
Utilized audio signal processing techniques to address the security concerns related to personal voice assistants, filling a gap in the existing research on securing these devices.
